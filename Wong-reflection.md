#Justin Wong's git and github reflections

##What Git concepts were you struggling with proir to the GPS session?
I had a harder time grasping the branch tree, mostly with making several commits within a single branch.  It was the basis of my learning today.

##What concepts were **clarified** during the GPS?
We learned in detail about the difference in clone, fetch, merge, and pull.

##What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked mostly about clarifying the instructions in the lesson plan.

##What still confuses you about *Git*?
I still need to practice making commits and merging.  we had struggled through merging for a while, but when i realize what needed to happen in order to create a merge conflict, we were successful.  I am hoping for my partner that she got the same educational experience that i got.

##How was your first experience of apiring in a GPS?
i rather enjoyed it.  it can seem awkward at first, because you have a lot of empty space that needs to be filled, but as long as you keep communicating about what you're working on at the time, i think it makes it less (although still) awkward.
