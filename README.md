# phase-0-gps-1
this is our first GPS!

we've used 

git clone - it pulled down the repo from github onto my local computer
git checkout -b -- this was a dual command, it allowed us to create a new branch, and move into it's working structure.

touch - create a file
ls - list items in a directory or folder
cd ..  back up out of a folder up the directory tree

git add .  -add the full directory

git commit -m "gjalksgd"
