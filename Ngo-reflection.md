    What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
      how to collaborate on GitHub. It was nice to go through the process of pull-request and merging with somebody else and we got to comment to each other.
    What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
      git merge conflict. It was strange as Justin's hangout went out partway through but we were able to communicate what was going on and we both have a pretty good understanding of why it didn't work out the first couple of times. Justin was able to figure out that the error had to do with uncommitted changes
    What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
      asked about how to delete just one commit
    What still confuses you about Git?
      would like to experience more git collaborations so I can understand the branching process of that better. Can't see that visually in my mind and that would make that easier.
    How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
      it was good. Justin was awesome and I'm still amazed we were able to get through a merge conflict with the problems we had.
